## Project Description:

This project is an online web app that allows Bookstore Owners to upload and edit Book information and inventory. User can search for, and browse through, the books in the bookstore, sort/filter them based on the above information. User can then decide to purchase one or many books by putting them in the Shopping Cart and proceeding to Checkout. User can also view Book Recommendations based on past purchases.
